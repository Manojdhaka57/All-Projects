                        <p>I’ve worked with countless consultants for many years. I’ve worked with teams that are good at what they do; from design, project management and development. However, Ajay and his team at Cloud Analogy stand apart from the other teams we’ve used. It’s rare to find someone with not only Ajay’s technical experience but just as important his and his team’s ability to fully understand our projects. We highly recommend Ajay and the team at Cloud Analogy. A+

                        <p>I was faced with a fast POC cycle and began researching Lightning implementation on line. I ran across an exchange in a forum, where the engineer answering someone else’s question left his Skype handle. I took a chance, contacted Suraj, and before I knew it was receiving FIRST class help from Ajay and his team – who helped me quickly turn a corner on my project. I highly recommend this team and expect to work with them again soon.

                        <p>I have a Salesforce premium subscription for support. Over time, I have been frustrated calling into Salesforce, getting different support people and some of them messing up my programs. So I hired AJ, owner of Cloud Analogy and asked him for help. He was able to set and program several things that took only 2 hours vs it would have taken Salesforce direct about 6-8 hours. I’m very satisfied with Cloud Analogy’s work and would recommend them to others.

                        <p>Ajay was a pleasure to work with. He communicates clearly and quickly understands the requirements. We were involved in a complex project and I had a lot of different requirements which were very detailed. I am amazed to have brought this project to completion. Ajay got exactly what I had envisioned on day 1 and worked through so many issues that were not imagined at the onset. I would highly recommend Ajay for anything Salesforce related. He and his team are world class and very patient. I will use Ajay in the future to maintain and add to what has been put in place.
